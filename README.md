# Parking-Assistance-System
Parking assistance system will measure the disctance between simulated car and the obstacles to ensure that no collision happens. A microcontroller and utransonic sensor is used for this purpose.

# Scope:
The scope of the project is to design, Implement and test parking assistance system. Following are the intended features of parking assistance system:
*	The device should be portable so it need to be powered by powered by batteries (2xAA). 
*	A beeper needs to be used to provide indication for car at different levels.
*	Power saving strategy need to be implemented. 

# Requirements:
To measure the distance between the simulated car (your Arduino system) and different objects, connect an ultrasonic sensor to your Arduino. Use a beeper to signal the distance to objects by differing tone frequencies. The resulting device must be powered by batteries (2xAA), so we have to integrate a power-saving strategy.

# Design:
Initial Design is created using Fritzing. The ultrasonic sensor,buzzer and a 3.5 battery is connected to arduino which is programmed to detect the objects at different levels and notify using the buzzer. MT3608 DC-DC Boost Converter will be used with the low powered arduino to minimize the input power for running the project.
